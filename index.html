<p>I seem to be making a habit of covering covers! This is one of the first songs I ever learnt, and listening to this
recent recording of it really shows me how much I&rsquo;ve improved over the years, hopefully that trend continues! Sometimes
it&rsquo;s nice to look back, and this song is one of my less embarrassing favourites from my angst phase.</p>

<p>This is a cover of a cover, Smith and Myers (of Shinedown) played a rendition of Someone Like You for their acoustic EP.
It sounds like a new Smith and Myers EP will be coming out soon, spurring me to have a go at this song.</p>

<p>Shinedown were a huge part of my early adventures into music, being one of the first bands I listened to that I hadn&rsquo;t heard
through my parents first. Brent Smith is still one of my personal heroes, overcoming his addictions and striving to help
people through his music, and what a vocalist. Whilst I don&rsquo;t gel quite as well with their more recent albums I have a
lot of nostalgia for their music, and endless respect for their talent.</p>

<p>More Glorious Sons! The guitar part for this song is a bit more technical than anything I&rsquo;ve uploaded so far, I think I
did an okay job of it! I can&rsquo;t stop playing songs by this band, I think the writing generally suits a one-man cover and
they&rsquo;re great fun to learn. I&rsquo;ll make sure my next cover is of a different band though.</p>

<p>This song is also (very) high in my register. I used to always stick to songs that let me sing in my lower register where
I feel the most comfortable, and would even transpose songs down if they felt too high to me. These days I&rsquo;m a bit more
at home in my head voice, although it&rsquo;s still outside of the norm for me. I think the rule is if I&rsquo;m having fun singing it
then hopefully having a go will push my boundaries a bit.</p>

<p>The Glorious Sons are a rock band from Canada, and they were the main soundtrack to the first roadtrip
me and some friends took around central Europe. After that we were lucky enough to catch them at a (free!)
gig in London, which cemented my love for the band as they swung from the rafters and belted out tune after
tune, the energy and heart of their performance makes it easy to feel a connection to the band live and get
lost in the moment.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve seen them a few times since, including on their cycle for A War On Everything (album).
Each time they blow me away all over again. This song is one of my favourites from the latest album, so I
threw together a quick and dirty cover.</p>

<p>Charles Leclerc took his first win in 2019 at Spa, in the wake of the heartbreaking loss of Anthoine Hubert in a crash
earlier that weekend, and dedicated his victory to his late friend. I felt this moment, originally captured by a Ferrari
hired photographer, captured the intense emotions that Leclerc must have been feeling as he climbed out of his Ferrari
after the race.</p>
