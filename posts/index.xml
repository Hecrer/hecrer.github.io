A much more low effort cover than my previous (expect more of this - I&amp;rsquo;m lazy). Sometimes it&amp;rsquo;s nice to just grab a guitar and try a rendition of a song you haven&amp;rsquo;t heard in years, Chasing Cars came out whilst I was in my early teens and I remember it doing the rounds at school on the twenty(ish) songs worth of storage mp3 players at the time.</description>

My take on Chapel Song, the first track on the album Rise Ye Sunken Ships by Augustines. I first saw this song on a live Cardinal Session on YouTube, and it&amp;rsquo;s been one of my favourite songs to play since.</description>

      <description>&#34;Valtteri, it&#39;s James.&#34; I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on some art for a new project that expands the service our Server Manager provides for Assetto Corsa. Here&amp;rsquo;s Bottas.
This was my first time using an iPad (the iPad Pro 2018, that I borrowed) to draw something, and i&amp;rsquo;m pretty happy with how it came out! Mixing the &amp;ldquo;real&amp;rdquo; feeling of using a traditional pencil directly onto a drawing surface with all of the added benefits that come with working in art software really does create a powerful and unique experience.</description>
